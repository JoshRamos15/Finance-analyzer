# Finance-analyzer
The Personal Finance Tracker and Visualizer project is a software program made to assist users in properly managing their finances. The absence of accessible tools that enable people to take charge of their own finances and the social issue of financial illiteracy served as the inspiration for the project. We became aware of this issue from chats with friends and family members who frequently battled with budgeting and financial planning. The software's main purpose is to give users an easy-to-use interface for tracking their spending across several categories, displaying their spending patterns, and establishing savings targets. The purpose of the program is to empower users to take control of their financial goals by encouraging them to become more aware of their spending habits.
